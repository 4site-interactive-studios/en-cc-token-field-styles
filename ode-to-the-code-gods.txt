An Ode to the Code Gods

In the sacred halls of syntax and scheme,
We crafted a script, a programmer’s dream.
With debounce as our shield, against stormy flows,
We tame the tempest that in the viewport grows.

In the div's deep shadows, hidden from sight,
Styles we set, with margins just right.
Visibility granted by a coder’s decree,
A container now seen, as it was meant to be.

An observer lies waiting for the node's silent call,
To update, to adapt, to stand proud and tall.
Through mutation's gateway, a frame does appear,
And the code to the gods, we now revere.
